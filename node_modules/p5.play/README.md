# p5.play [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/molleindustria/p5.play.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/molleindustria/p5.play)

[p5.play][] is a 2D game engine made by Computer Science teachers to help you turn your game ideas into JavaScript code!

It uses [p5.js][] for graphics rendering. We share the Processing Foundation's goal of make coding more accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. Behind the scenes p5.play v3 uses planck (Box2D), a physics simulator that's been used in popular 2D games like Angry Birds and Tiny Wings.

Ready to learn how to use p5.play to prototype, develop, and publish games? [Version 3][] is in late beta testing and will be released in August 2022. [Try it out today!][]
